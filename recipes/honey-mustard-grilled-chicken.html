    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Honey Mustard Grilled Chicken was my favorite, a small, delicate chicken breast that didn't need to cook, that was probably easier to eat. Not even its skin needed to peel off. Just a simple browned skin that would come off with a flick of my finger.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>⅓ cup Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>¼ cup honey</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon steak sauce</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the grill for medium heat.</li>
            <li>In a shallow bowl, mix the mustard, honey, mayonnaise, and steak sauce. Set aside a small amount of the honey mustard sauce for basting, and dip the chicken into the remaining sauce to coat.</li>
            <li>Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill chicken over indirect heat for 18 to 20 minutes, turning occasionally, or until juices run clear. Baste occasionally with the reserved sauce during the last 10 minutes. Watch carefully to prevent burning!</li>
